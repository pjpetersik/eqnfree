# Example: Recurrent neural network (RNN) car-following model
In this directory an example code is given for the computation of a bifurcation analysis of an recurrent neural network car-following model. The neural network car-following model is the same as in my repository "neural-network-car-following-model". In this model, cars are driving on a circuit using the RNN to predict the acceleration. When the circuit length "L" is varied traffic jams appear/are not present. The occurence of a jam can be measured (for instance) by the standard deviation of the headways (distance to the leading car). If the standard deviation of the headways is 0, no traffic jam is present. If it is non-zero a jam wave is present in the model.
